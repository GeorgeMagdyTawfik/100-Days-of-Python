# üêç Snake Game
Python is a family of nonvenomous snakes, this is one of them üòÇ

# What is the game ?
This is your classic arcade game in which a snake is always moving tying to eat some food.

Every time the snake eats (touches) a piece of food it grows.

With this growth comes a challenge for you: **To control this snake and to prevent it from touching the edge of the screen or touching his own tail.**
*While trying to beat my highscore : ) and grow as much as possible*

## How to instal and run
* Make sure you have installed Python from [Python.org](https://www.python.org/)
* Just download and run the python script on your PC
* Run using : `python snake_game.py`

## How to Play ? üéÆ
* The snake is always moving, you can only direct it
* Using the Up, Down, Left, Right arrow keys üîΩ üîº ‚óÄ ‚ñ∂
* Press e to stop the game and save your highscore üèÅ
* the you click the window or can press q, or you can simply click ‚ùå on the top right
* **Then press q to exit** (sorry if it seems strange üòÖ)

## Used modules
* **Turtle** : for handling the GUI screen
* **Random** : for placing the food randomly on the screen
* **Time** : for delays and speed control

## Why this was built ?
To learn by using a technique called project based learning.<br>
I believe in learning by doing. Python is no exception.

## Confessions
* This was not what I really wanted to build as the final project for CS50<br>
I built a simple script that lets me download video/ audio from a youtube link.<br>
But I felt that it was too short/small to be considered as a final project<br>
Also I felt that it was a little bit illegal
* I did not build this from scratch, a lot of it was inspired by a former experience from a course called 100 days of code on Udemy by Dr.Angela Yu
